# Add Issues to a GitHub Project (Manual)

1) Open your GitHub project board in the browser.
2) In a second tab, open the repository issues list.
3) Filter issues by label or search for the imported titles.
4) Select all issues that should belong to the project.
5) Use "Add to project" in the issue sidebar (or bulk add from the list view).
6) Verify the issues appear in the project and apply any project-specific fields.

Notes:
- Ensure you are authenticated in GitHub with access to the repo and project.
- If you prefer CLI, use `gh project item-add` for each issue.
